mode: log                      # Either 'log' or 'playback'
file: test.json                     # path to the file with the controls


This is the configuration file of the human agent. This agent incorporates two modes.
The log mode parses the controls given to the vehicle into a dictionary and records them into a .json file.
This file can be read by the playback mode to control the vehicle in the same way, resulting in a deterministic agent.
The file name can be chosen, and is the second argument of this config file.
